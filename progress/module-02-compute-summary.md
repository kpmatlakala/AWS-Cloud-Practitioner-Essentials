# Module 2: Compute in the Cloud - Summary

## ðŸ“… Day 2 Progress
<!-- **Date**: 16/102025   -->
**Status**: Completed  
<!-- **Next Module**: Module 3 - Exploring Compute Services -->

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Concepts Covered

### Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- Virtual servers in the cloud with flexible computing capacity
- Various instance types for different workload requirements
- Multiple pricing models: On-Demand, Reserved, Spot Instances

### Auto Scaling & Load Balancing
- **EC2 Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts instance count based on demand
- **Elastic Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple instances
- Ensures high availability and fault tolerance

### Messaging & Queuing Services
- **Amazon SQS**: Message queuing for decoupling application components
- **Amazon SNS**: Notification service for SMS, email, push notifications

## ðŸ’¡ Core Learnings
- How to choose appropriate EC2 instance types for different use cases
- Strategies for cost optimization with different pricing models
- Scaling applications to handle variable traffic loads
- Building decoupled architectures with messaging services

## ðŸš€ Practical Applications
- Web application hosting with auto-scaling capabilities
- Batch processing with cost-effective spot instances
- Microservices communication through message queues
- Real-time notifications and alerts
