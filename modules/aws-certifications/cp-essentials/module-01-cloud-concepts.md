# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials -
## Module 1: Introduction to Cloud | AWS - Notes

<!-- ## üìÖ Date: 15/10/2025 -->

## üéØ Key Concepts Learned

### 1. What is Cloud Computing?
- **Definition**: On-demand delivery of IT resources over internet with pay-as-you-go pricing
- **Four Components**:
  1. On-demand delivery
  2. IT resources (servers, storage, databases, networking)
  3. Over the internet
  4. Pay-as-you-go pricing

### 2. Cloud Deployment Models
- **Cloud-based**: Fully in cloud (migrate existing or build new)
- **On-premises**: Traditional IT (like legacy infrastructure)
- **Hybrid**: Combination of cloud and on-premises

### 3. Six Benefits of AWS Cloud
1. **Trade fixed expense for variable expense** - No upfront costs
2. **Benefit from massive economies of scale** - Lower prices through AWS volume
3. **Stop guessing capacity** - Scale based on actual demand
4. **Increase speed and agility** - Faster experimentation and innovation
5. **Stop spending money running data centers** - Focus on customers, not infrastructure
6. **Go global in minutes** - Deploy worldwide quickly

### 4. AWS Global Infrastructure
- **Regions**: Geographical areas with multiple Availability Zones
- **Availability Zones**: Isolated locations within Regions (one or more data centers)

### 5. AWS Shared Responsibility Model
- **AWS Responsibility**: Security OF the cloud (physical infrastructure, hardware)
- **Customer Responsibility**: Security IN the cloud (data, applications, OS patches)

## üí° Key Insights

### Client-Server Model (Coffee Shop Analogy)
- **Client**: Makes requests (customer ordering coffee)
- **Server**: Processes requests and responds (barista making coffee)
- **Cloud Computing**: Provides scalable server resources accessible over internet

### Real-World Application
- **Netflix, Airbnb, Slack** all use AWS for scalability and global reach
- Startups can access enterprise-grade infrastructure without huge upfront investment

## üß† Practice Questions Summary
From the 8 assessment questions:
- Correctly identified hybrid deployment for compliance scenarios
- Understood customer vs AWS security responsibilities
- Recognized capacity guessing as a key cloud benefit
